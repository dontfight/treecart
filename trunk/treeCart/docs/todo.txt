question:  how to integrate with facebook?
answer: facebook is the live network.  people will be sharing cabins with each other.  build a realestate gallery boasting a user's list of properties.  price is involved as well as work in trade, and the terms therein.  if you become my friend you gain access to my network of properties, which also includes hell.

no reviews, only comments ... we assume any one commenting is asing a question, or asserting a good time had.
